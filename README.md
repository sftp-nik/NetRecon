# Network Scanner and OS Detection Tool

## Overview
This tool is a Python script designed for **comprehensive network scanning and OS detection**. It scans a specified range of ports on a target IP address, detects service versions running on open ports, and identifies the operating system of the target machine using Nmap.

## Features
- **Port Scanning:** Efficiently scans a range of ports to identify open and closed ports.
- **Service Version Detection:** Determines service versions running on open ports via HTTP requests.
- **Operating System Detection:** Uses Nmap for accurate OS detection.

## Usage
1. **Input:** Provide the target IP address and the range of ports to scan.
2. **Execution:** Run the script (`python script.py`) and follow the prompts.
3. **Results:** View the port scanning results, service versions on open ports, and OS detection details.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Nmap (for OS detection)

## Installation and Execution
1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. **Ensure Python 3.x and Nmap are installed**.
3. **Open a terminal** and navigate to the project directory.
4. **Run the script** using `python3 script.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the target IP and port range.
